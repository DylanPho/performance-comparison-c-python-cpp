# Review of Cython and Pyrex

## Cython
- A superset of Python designed to optimize performance by translating Python code into C.
- Allows for inline type declarations to speed up computational tasks.
- Commonly used for scientific computing and wrapping C/C++ libraries.

### Pros
- Easy integration with Python.
- Significant performance gains for CPU-bound tasks.

### Cons
- Learning curve for type declarations.
- Requires a C compiler for setup.

## Pyrex
- An earlier tool for writing Python extensions in C-like syntax.
- Simplifies wrapping of C libraries but lacks the modern features of Cython.

### Pros
- Simple to learn and use for small extensions.

### Cons
- Largely outdated and replaced by Cython.
